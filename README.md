### About this project
Google map is an application that everyone uses everyday to find the shortest path to their location using different path finding algorithms. The solution for the project is coded in python and the algorithm is A* path finding algorithms, I using pygame library to visualise the process of finding the shortest path to the location. 

User can left click the mouse on any square on the programmed to make a node. The first node that user going to make when left click are the starting point, the second node is the finished point and then there are obstacle node. 

User can right click the mouse on any square that have a node to delete that node. If the start or finish node are deleted, the next left click is going to make the that node first before the obstacle node.

**Note: pygame library need to be installed before running this project.**
